multisim is a shell script that drives a parallel simulation out of a file
or from standard input. The simulator program is specified in the command line.

Usage: multisim [[-F|-C] a_file][-v] PROGRAM OPTIONS

-F	Specifies an ASCII event file to be fed into PROGRAM
-C	Specifies a compressed ASCII event file to be fed into PROGRAM
-v	Causes the script to display verbose output (not implemented yet)

PROGRAM is the simulator program. In theory, it can be everything that
understands ASCII events in R3BRoot format.

OPTIONS are the options to be passed to the program. Note that multisim
intercepts -o and --output-file options and uses it to save partial outputs.
If those partial outputs sum at less than 99GiB, hadd is called and the files
are joined.

NOTE: this scrips uses "evtmux", which must be reachable.
NOTE: this script, so far, assumes that the simulator is based on ROOT and
      therefore hadd is reachable (due to ROOT reachability).
