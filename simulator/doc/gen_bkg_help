Usage: gbkg [INPUT_FILES] [OPTIONS]

All the argument non preceded by "-" are treated as input file names.
After the first option appears, file names are no longer looked for.

The program prints to STDOUT unless an output file name is specified,
or the option "--output-many" is selected, causing the program to guess
the output file names (one for each input file).

By default, the program appends if a single output file is specified
and overwrites if the file names are guessed. This behavior cannot be
changed, as yet.

When an output file name is specified the program uses bzip2 to compress
the ASCII output, unless the option "--no-compression" is selected.
Note that compression takes time.

OPTIONS:
	-v | --verbose :
		causes the program to print statements about itself
		on STDOUT. Do not use while piping into another
		program!
		
	-d | --debug :
		sets a "debug" flag for the conversion engine, causing
		it to print statements about itself on STDOUT.
		
	-i | --input-file <name>: DEPRECATED.
		pass A SINGLE input file to the program.
		If other input files were passed before
		the options, they are discarded.
		Really, don't use.
		
	-o | --output-ascii :
		sets the name of the single output file used
		for all the input files. The file is always updated.
	
	--output-many :
		Causes the program to create one output file for each
		input file provided. The names are derived from the input
		files' ones and files are always overwritten.
	
	--target-histogram <name>:
		Indicates to the program which histogram to target for
		conversion. Available options are (because ABKG):
			h1 -- default.
			h2
	--nb-events <integer>:
		sets the maximum number of events to be processed.
		The default is 10^5.
	
	--tot-cs <float>:
		specifies the total cross section to be used.
		The default is 10^4.
	
	--target-thickness <float>:
		specifies the thickness of the target.
		The default is 0.519.
	
	--target-density <float>:
		specifies the density of the target.
		The default is 11.35.
	
	--target-molar-mass <float>:
		specifies the molar mass of the target.
		The default is 207.2 (natural lead).
	
	--no-compression :
		causes the program to produce an uncompressed ASCII file.
		WARNING: the output is around 1 GiB (compared to 100 MiB
		of the compressed output) for a batch of 10^5 events.
	
	-h | --help :
		displays this help.
