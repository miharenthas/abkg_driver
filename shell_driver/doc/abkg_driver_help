Usage: ./abkg_driver [OPTIONS]

Where OPTIONS are:
--template-root <string>: sets the prefix of the template file that
                          will be used as a base for the simulation.
                          The recommended format is:
                              <A><elem_beam>_<A><elem_target>_
                          To which "TEMPLATE.abkg" is appended.

--file-name <string>: sets the output file name tail
                      aMeV[energy]_<string>
-f <string>: like --file-name

--energy-range <begin> <step> <end> : sets the energy range
                                      starts from <begin>
                                      ends at <end>
                                      stepping of <step>
-E <begin> <step> <end> : like --energy-range

-e <energy> : launch on one single energy.

--en-gamma: sets EN_GAMMA
--en-sigma: sets EN_SIGMA
--ang-cut: sets ANG_CUT

--target-thickness <number> : sets the thickness of the target.
                              The default is 1.134 (g/cm^2).

--atomic-xsection <number> : sets the cross section of the atomic
                             processes. The default is 1.07e5.
--atomic-xs-range <begin> <step> <end> : sets a range of atomic cross
                                         sections instead of just one.
-X <begin> <step> <end> : same as --atomic-xs-range.

--spc-start <start> : sets the lowest energy of the spectrum
--s <start> : same as --spc-start

--spc-stop <stop> : sets the highest energy of the spectrum
-S <stop> : same as --spc-stop

--spc-bin <bin>: sets the bin of the energy spectrum
-b <bin> : same as --spc-bin

--angle-start <angle> : sets the start of the solid angle considered
                        actually, the beginning of the aperture from
                        the beam axis. It is assumed that the system
                        is symmetric around the bea axis.
-a <angle> : same as --angle-start

--angle-stop <angle> : sets the stop of the solid angle considered.
-A <angle> : same as --angle-stop

--angle-step <n_of_divisions> : sets the stepping with which the angle is
                                incremented. 361 is maximum.
-t <n_of_divisions> : same as --angle-step

--output-dir <name> : a directory where to save all the stuff produced.

--detector-list <detector list> : passes a detector list to the simulator.
                                  Please refer to sbkg documentation for
                                  more info about the format.

--no-compression : if selected, the output of gbkg is not passed through
                   bzip2 before being saved. Acts only if no simulation
                   is performed or if evey file generated is kept.
                   NOTE: if you select this while running a simulation
                         and you want to keep everything, expect longer
                         run time than usual.

--keep-everything : don't remove intermediate files.
                    NOTE: this makes the whole process SLOWER!

--do-simulation : a simulation is run, using sbkg. One per member in range.

--mux-simulation : a simulation is run, usign sbkg. Simulation is split in
                   so many parts as many CPUs are online and each is run
                   independently; outputs are then merged using hadd (silenced).
                   NOTE: not yet available with --keep-everything.
                   NOTE: this is useful if you have a *small* number of
                         background to simulate. If that is large enough
                         a bug un Geant3 will rear its head and you're
                         getting problems (or delays).

--save-geometry: saves the geometry into the simulation output,
                 for event visualization.

--help : displays this message and exits.
-h: same as --help.
