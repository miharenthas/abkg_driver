Welcome to p2a, a program that brings photons in the nucleus' frame of reference and produces R3B ASCII events -- bodgelogger friendly(*)!

===
COMPILE the program:
===

1. Make sure you have the GNU Scientific Library installed and reachable, either in the system default search paths or with $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH properly set.
Any version that came out in the last 5 years should do --but I didn't test it extensively.

2. Put yourself in the directory where the Makefile is, make sure that the directories "bin" and "lib" are present (if they are not, make will complain and fail).
  
  $ make -j$(nproc) #or simply make.

3. Optionally, you can use the install.sh script to install a program in a reasonable OS (won't work on the GSI machines).

  $ sudo ./install.sh

4. Now you're ready to start.

===
USE the program:

  $ p2a [FILES] [OPTIONS]

FILES: are the input files: you can specify up to 64 of them, because of lazy.
The program will read photons also from the standard input, so you may consider that option also.

OPTIONS:
	--verbose | -v
		Print some information about the execution to the standard output.
	
	--beam-a | -A <number>
		Set the mass number of the beam.
		If the option is not selected, the default 132 is used.
	
	--beam-z | -Z <number>
		Set the element (charge) of the beam.
		If the option is not selected, the default 50 is used.
	
	--beam-energy | -e <number>
		Set the beam energy -- the energy of the emitting nucleus when gammas are emitted.
		If not specified, 0.490 aGeV is used.
		NOTE: p2a doesn't yet support target information and doesn't calculate the energy
		      loss by itself. You may want to calculate how fast your nucleus is going
		      in the middle of your target beforehand and use that value.
	
	--beam-versor | -d [<number>,<number>,<number>]
		Set the beam direction.
		If for any reason you have a beam in a weird direction, set it with this option.
		If not specified, the default [0,0,1] is used.
		NOTE: a spread in the beam direction is not yet supported. It might be in the future.
	
	--solid-angle | -a from[<theta>,<phi>]to[<theta>,<phi>]
		Set a target solid angle.
		By default, the photons are distributed uniformly on 4pi in the nucleus' frame of reference. If you want to target a specific solid angle for any reason, you can use this option.
		NOTE: the angle is specified according to the ISO standard: given the versor V
		      -- theta is the angle with the Z axis, measured from positive (of a right handed FoR)
		      -- phi is the angle with the Y axis, measured from positive
	
	--gaussian-energy-spread | -g <sigma>
		Set a gaussian energy distribution for the beam, centered at -e and with this sigma.
		If not specified, no gaussian distribution is used.
	
	--input | -i <file name>
		Set one input file (will discard any other file)
	
	--output | -o <file name>
		Set the output file.
		If not specified, the output is printed to the standart output.

NOTE: this, as with all the programs in here, it's not rock solid and you will stumble into horrible bugs. Please report them to me and I'll try to fix them!
