This file is a barebone guide on how to run and operate ABKG

0) make sure CERNLIB is reachable. If not, call it up.

1) get a configuration file from "config_files" (the anatomy of those files is described in its own document but it should be commented).

2) $ ./abkg --it will request a config file. You should specify the path to it.

3) if the config file is valid, it works for a bit and then produces a .hst output. Otherwise it will crash in some horrible way.

4) the .hst file is not a ROOT file; call up ROOT if it is not alreay reachable.

5) $ h2root <your_hst_file.hst>

6) Congratulations! You have a simulated background. To convert it in useful information for R3BRoot, you need Dominic's script "gen_bkg_from_histo.C"
