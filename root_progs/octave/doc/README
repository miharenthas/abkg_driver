This directory contains the interface to read and write with GNU Octave ASCII events
meant to be used in the R3B ASCII generator.

It (obviously) requires GNU Octave, installed and reachable.
In effect, the toolkit in ../ is not necessary for compilation: although the functions
here take a lot of inspiration from what's in the toolkit, none is directly included.

To compile:
    $ cd [wherever]/abkg_driver/octave/
    $ make all -j$( nproc )

To install in GNU Octave, in the xb_progs/octave dir:
    $ octave --no-gui (or use the GUI prompt to type what follows)
    > addpath( [pwd, "/oct/"] );
    > savepath;

Basic usage documentation is provided via Octave's "help <fn>" command.
For more extensive information about the content of the data structures, please
refer to the documentaton of the toolkit, found in xb_progs/doc/.
