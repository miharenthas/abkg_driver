Usage: ./r3bsim_ascii [FILE] [OPTIONS]

Runs a simulation of the R3B setup, specified in the options,
  with the events saved in an ASCII FILE. If no file is specified, either
  directly or via the --event-file option, STDIN is used.

FILE is the file, saved in ASCII format, that contains the event
  information. For how this file is supposed to be formatted,
  please read "r3bsim_ascii_howto".

Options:
  -i --event-file <name>     Sets <name> as an input ASCII file.
  
  -o --output-file <name>    Sets <name> as the output ROOT file.
                               Although not mandatoty, it's recommended
                               that such a file bears the ".root" suffix.
                               The default is "r3bsim.root".
                               
  -p --parameter-file <name> Sets <name> as the parameter file.
                               Although not mandatoty, it's recommended
                               that such a file bears the ".root" suffix.
                               The default is "r3bpar.root".
  
  -n --nb-events <integer>   Sets the maximum number of events to be used
                               in the simulation. If this exceeds the number
                               of events present in FILE, the simulation ends
                               prematurely.
  
  -v --verbose               Verbose output. Note that there will be some
                               output to STDOUT event when this options is
                               not specified (ROOT stuff).
  
  --detector-list <list>     Passes the list of detectors with their options
                               to the simulator. Note that the default is no
                               detector at all. See belo for the format.
  
  --magnet-current <float>   Sets the current of the magnet used
                               in the simulation.
                               
  --no-magnet                If selected, runs a simulation without a magnet.
  
  --save-geometry            If selected, the geometry and track information
                                is stored in the output file, making the
                                event visualization possible.
  
  --target-material <string> Sets the material of the target. Note that this
                                property can also be passed with the detector
                                list (and so it should).
  
  --mem-limit <long int>     Sets a limit for the memory usable by the program.
                                It's in bytes and the defaul is 1GiB.
  
  -h --help                  Displays this help and exits with 0 status.

Detector list format:
The list of detectors is a string composed by the ALL CAPS name of the detector
preceded and followed by :COLUMNS:
If a detector has more than one geometry (aka, more than one version), this
is appended to the detector :NAMEv99z:
If a detector has options, these may follow its name and need not be
surrounded by columns. So far, the only detector that takes options is
:TARGET:[LeadTarget,LiH,Para,Para45].
An example of a legal detector list is:

:TARGET:LeadTarget:CRYSTALBALL:ALADIN:STaRTrackv14a:LAND:

Note that everything that is not a valid name or option is silently discarded.
